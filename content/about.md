Hi. My name is Guilherme Duarte. I work as a data scientist for a major newspaper in Brazil. I'm also a Doctoral candidate in Constitutional Law at University of Sao Paulo (Brazil). I apply models to political and general phenomena in order to understand its main features. I'm addicted to R. I program in python as well. My interests are: programming, law, political science, methodology, statistics, data science, and music (seriously).
