# How to implement a simple gradient descent procedure in Rcpp

In this post, we will implement a simple gradient descent function in c++ directly inside R, employing the package Rcpp. This post intends to show how sometimes c++ can be used to make code faster in some circumstances.

Gradient descent is an algorithm for optimization of functions with low peaks. This procedures tries 


Suppose a
